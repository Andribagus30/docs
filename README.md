## 

## Run locally

To run locally:

1. Get the content from the downstream repos.

    ```
    ./get-content.sh
    ```

3. Build and serve locally.

   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,staticman.yml
   ```

   Use this format to turn on production features:

   ```
   JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml
   ```

## Deploy via Netlify

To deploy to Netlify:

1. Build the site.

    ```
    JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml
    ```
2. Force add the `_site` directory.

    ```
    git push -f origin
    ```

## Test a Deploy with Surge


```
cd _site
surge
```

```
surge --domain raspy-songs.surge.sh

# To generate the CLI json manually

The `_data/cliRef.json` file is generated from the `blockstack-cli` subcommand `docs`. This data file is consumed by the `_includes/commandline.md` file which is used to serve up the reference.  

1. Install the latest version of the cli according to the instructions at: https://github.com/blockstack/cli-blockstack

2. Generate the json for the cli in the `docs.blockstack` repo.

   ```
   $ blockstack-cli docs | python -m json.tool > _data/cliRef.json 
   ```

3. Make sure the generated docs are clean by building the documentation.

   If you run into any problem in the generation usually it results from a problem in the repo. You can make a pull request back to the repo to fix anything.

## Clarity Reference

As of 8/12/19 Clarity is in the [develop](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/develop) branch of core.  You can build the Clarity command line from the Docker image. `core/src/vm/docs/mod.rs`


1. Pull the latest developer preview from the Docker Hub.

   ```
   $ docker pull blockstack/blockstack-core:clarity-developer-preview
   ```

2. Build the lastest JSON.

   ```
   docker run -it blockstack/blockstack-core:clarity-developer-preview blockstack-core docgen | jsonpp > ~/repos/docs.blockstack/_data/clarityRef.json
   ```

3. Build the documentation and verify the Clarity reference is building correctly.

4. Make changes in core
5. Build the docker image
6. Run doc gen with the new image

    ```
   $ docker run --name docsbuild -it blockstack-test blockstack-core docgen | jsonpp > ~/repos/docs.blockstack/_data/clarityRef.json
    ```
## To view the clarity cli

You can view [the source code](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/blob/develop/src/clarity.rs).

1. Pull the Blockstack core clarity-developer-preview image from Docker Hub.

   ```bash
    $ docker pull blockstack/blockstack-core:clarity-developer-preview
   ```

2. Start the Blockstack Core test environment with a Bash shell.

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it -v $HOME/blockstack-dev-data:/data/ blockstack/blockstack-core:clarity-developer-preview bash
    ```

    The command launches a container with the Clarity test environment and opens a bash shell into the container.

3. Run the clarity-cli in the shell.

    ```bash
    root@5b9798633251:/src/blockstack-core# clarity-cli
    Usage: clarity-cli [command]
    where command is one of:

    initialize         to initialize a local VM state database.
    mine_block         to simulated mining a new block.
    get_block_height   to print the simulated block height.
    check              to typecheck a potential contract definition.
    launch             to launch a initialize a new contract in the local state database.
    eval               to evaluate (in read-only mode) a program in a given contract context.
    eval_raw           to typecheck and evaluate an expression without a contract or database context.
    repl               to typecheck and evaluate expressions in a stdin/stdout loop.
    execute            to execute a public function of a defined contract.
    generate_address   to generate a random Stacks public address for testing purposes.
    ```

## Understand how the shared FAQs work

The FAQ system servers single-sourced content that support the FAQs that appear in blockstack.org, app.co, and stacks.com site. We have FAQs that fall into these categories:

* general 
* appusers
* dappdevs
* appminers
* coredevs
* opensource
* miscquest
* wallet  (Wallet users)
* tokens (Stacks owners)

FAQ content is created by the Jekyll build and served throughout the documentation site. Single sourcing the content ensures that FAQs are the same regardless of where and on which property they appear in. These files participate in the FAQ:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File </th>
    <th>Contains</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_faqs/allfaqs.json</td>
    <td>Liquid to generate JSON from theFAQS.json</td>
    <td>Serves up the FAQs that are consumed by the blockstack.org and stacks.com sites.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_develop/faq-data.json</td>
    <td>Liquid to generate JSON from appFAQ.json.</td>
    <td>Serves up the FAQs that are consumed by the app.co site. <br><br>NOTE: App.co was never changed to pull from the same file as blockstack.org. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_faqs/allFAQs.md</td>
    <td>Liquid and headings.</td>
    <td>Reads the _data/theFAQs.json and produces a Markdown file for display in our site.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_data/theFAQs.json</td>
    <td>JSON for the FAQS.</td>
    <td>Source file for all the FAQs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_data/appFAQ.json</td>
    <td>JSON for the app mining FAQs.</td>
    <td>Source file for the application mining FAQs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_develop/appMiningFAQ.md</td>
    <td>Liquid to extract the app mining FAQs from the allFAQs.json file.</td>
    <td>Display just the app mining FAQs in the docs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

FAQs are usually written internally by a team that are unfamiliar with markdown or HTML used in websites. So, FAQs are produced using this process:

1. Draft new or revised FAQs in a Google or Paper document.
2. Review the drafts and approve them.
3. Convert the FAQ document to HTML.
4. Strip out the unnecessary codes such as `id` or `class` designations. 
   This leaves behind plain html.
5. Add the new FAQs to the `_data/theFAQS.json` file.
   Currently this is manually done through cut and paste. 
6. Copy the JSON for `appminers` categories to the `_data/appFAQ.json` file.
