This page assumes you have customized and deployed your Animal Kingdom as
[described in part 3](zero_to_dapp_3).


## Add your Animal Kingdom to App.co

App.co accepts applications from all decentralized protocols such as Ethereum,
Blockstack, and many others. When you add an app, it is not automatically
eligible for application mining, you must submit it using an another procedure.
You can also submit an application for App Mining but not add it to App.co.

In this section, you add your Animal Kingdom to the **Blockstack Sample
Application** category on App.co.  Adding your Animal Kingdom app to this
category earns you a limited edition a Zero-to-DApp t-shirt. Only submit your
sample application if you have deployed the application on the internet. This
allows us to confirm you completed the tutorial. You can submit more than one
example, only your first submission receives a t-shirt.

To add an app, do the following:

1. In your browser, navigate to <a href="https://app.co/" target="\_blank">the App.co website</a>.
2. Choose **Add your app** option from the menu.

   The system opens the submit your App form.
