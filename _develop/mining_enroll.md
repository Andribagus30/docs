{% include warning.html content="You must complete enrollment including <b>submission of verification materials and BTC address</b> prior to the month in which you wish to be considered. If your submission is incomplete it will not be reviewed. Please note that the W9 or W8 process may take time to complete. No late submissions will be accepted, but we'll be happy to include you in the following month's ranking. You should register early to allow for sufficient time for collection of all required materials." %}


## Complete the add and submission forms on App.co

Make sure you enroll at least one business week in advance of the month you
would first like your app to complete.  You need only enroll in App Mining once.  A single
submission enrolls your app in the month you submit and every month following
automatically.

To apply, do the following:

1. Integrate Blockstack Auth into your app.

   Your application code can reside in a public or a private repository.

2. Complete the  <a href="https://app.co/submit" target="\_blank">App.co</a> form.

   You should fill out all the required fields.
