         "answer":"<p>Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing network that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely. Blockstack uses blockchain technology to build protocols and developer tools designed to enable a fair and open Internet that returns digital rights to developers and consumers. Led by some of the world’s foremost experts on distributed systems, Blockstack allows users to own their own data that they can take with them from app to app in the ecosystem, along with their Blockstack ID that eliminates the need for password-based logins. The end result is privacy, security, and freedom.</p>"

         "answer":"<p>Decentralized computing has these attributes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Personal keys for a digital life</strong>. Users will have keys that unlock all their software interactions, email, subscriptions, and social. These keys are in users’ hands and under their control similar to physical keys (in some cases they are physical). Corporations  no longer create or manage these keys.</li> <li><strong>Security is a first-class concern</strong>.  Users want systems that protect both their identity and the data associated with that identity — health, application, and relationships.</li> <li><strong>Convenient and auditable.</strong> Applications will be readily available as cloud applications are today but will be written with open protocols and code that allow them to be audited.</li> <li><strong>Innovation focused.</strong> The code and data in a decentralized computing lacks corporate and other boundaries, as a result, a global workforce can easily contribute and benefit from them.</li> </ul> <p>Blockstack technology is a shift in how people use software, create it, and benefit from the internet. It puts people back in control of the computing systems that manage today’s world.</p>"

         "answer":"<p>Applications developed with Blockstack’s technology run like the traditional, web applications you know. Unlike traditional, web applications, DApps avoid abusing users by adhering to the following principles:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Users control their data, not the application developer.</strong> If you stop using an application, the application cannot access your data. When you leave the application, you take your data with you.</li> <li><strong>Users determine where to store their data.</strong> You can store your data on your computer. Alternatively, you can choose highly-available commercial storage providers you trust. The providers can only host your data; it is encrypted so they cannot “unlock” it to view.</li> <li><strong>Users control which applications and which third parties can access their data.</strong> Applications ask your permission to read your data, and you can withdraw those same permissions at any time. Applications cannot sell or mine your data on behalf of a third party you are unaware of.</li> </ul>"

Developers can start programming using the same Javascript functionality they are currently familiar with.</li> <li>Application data is stored off the blockchain for performance and scalability.</li> <li>Blockstack ensures that all user data is signed and verified and (optionally) encrypted end-to-end, so users and developers can treat storage providers like dumb hard drives.</li> <li>Developers do not host user data. Since users supply their storage and use public-key cryptography for authentication, applications don’t have to store anything–there’s nothing to steal when applications are hacked.</li> <li>Moreover, many Web applications today can be refactored so that everything happens client-side, obviating the need for running dedicated application servers.</li> </ul> "

This grant was subject to a three-year time lock commencing upon the introduction of the genesis block to the Blockstack network in November 2018, and the nominal price reflected the early, high-risk support of founders and early employees.</p> <p><strong>Holders of Blockstack’s Series A convertible preferred stock</strong>—who had invested a total of $5.1 million as of late 2016 and funded Blockstack’s early growth and development before the decision to create a token, or the drafting or publication of any white papers—were also provided an opportunity to purchase tokens at the $0.00012 per token price. This opportunity to participate at a nominal price was given in return for their early support and in proportion to their equity ownership, and it was based on their reasonable expectation as early investors that they would receive tokens if Blockstack ever decided to create a digital token.
