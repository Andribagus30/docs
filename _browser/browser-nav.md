On this page, you learn more about working with **IDs**, the **Wallet**, and **Settings**.

## Working with IDS

Blockstack allows you to create one free identity in the Blockstack
_namespace_.  A namespace a top-level category in the Blockstack Ecosystem.  A
namespace is similar to the domains you are familiar with from using the web,
`google.com` is domain and so is the `gouvernement.fr` domain. An identity in
the `.blockstack` namespace has the _`username`_`.id.blockstack` format.

You can also purchase your own identity (`.id`) using bitcoin (BTC). A name's price depends on its length in characters and the current Bitcoin fees. For example, ranges such as  .00831 and .001943 BTC  20-80 US dollars is not unusual.
